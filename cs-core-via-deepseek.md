## 💡 Key Success Principles

1. **Start Before You Feel Ready** - Research is learned by doing
2. **Embrace Incremental Progress** - Small, consistent efforts build expertise
3. **Seek Multiple Mentors** - Different perspectives accelerate learning
4. **Document Everything** - Research notebooks are critical for reproducibility
5. **Focus on Process Over Outcomes** - Quality contributions follow quality methods

This framework adapts to any STEM field by adjusting the domain-specific technical skills while maintaining the same mathematical foundations and research methodology principles.
